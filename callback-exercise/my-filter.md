### My-filter

This program aims to be a function prepared to receive an array and another function as parameters. 

The function should valuate a condition that returns true or false.

The program should be able to apply to each element of the array the function passed as the second parameter and return a new array with elements that accomplish the condition of function. 


Case 1:
The first parameter should be an array

As a user, when I pass not an array as first parameter to the program, we see an error in the console that says 'first parameter is not an array'.

Case 2:
The second parameter should be a function

As a user, when I pass not a function as second parameter to the program, we see an error in the console that says 'second parameter is not a function'.

Case 3:
Number is bigger than 1

As a user, when I pass an array with numbers [1,2,3,4,5] and call to the program, we get a new array with all numbers bigger than 1.

Case 4:
Number is bigger than 2

As a user, when I pass an array with numbers [1,2,3,4,5] and call to the program, we get a new array with all numbers bigger than 2.


Case 5:
Number is bigger than 3

As a user, when I pass an array with numbers [1,2,3,4,5] and call to the program, we get a new array with all numbers bigger than 3.

Case 6:
Number is smaller than 3

As a user, when I pass an array with numbers [1,2,3,4,5] and call to the program, we get a new array with all numbers smaller than 3.

Case 7:
Number is even

As a user, when I pass an array with numbers [1,2,3,4,5] and call to the program, we get a new array with all even numbers.

Case 8:
Number is odd

As a user, when I pass an array with numbers [1,2,3,4,5] and call to the program, we get a new array with all odd numbers.

Case 9:
User name is Pepito

As a user, when I pass an array with names [{name: 'Pepita', surname: 'Grillo', age: 25}, { name: 'Maria', surname: 'Martinez', age: 35}, {name: 'Pepito', surname: 'Grillo', age: 27}, {name: 'Pepito', surname: 'Sanchez', age: 45} ] and call to the program, we get a new array with all users with Pepito's name.
