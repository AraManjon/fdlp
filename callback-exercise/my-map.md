### My-map

This program aims to be a function prepared to receive an array and another function as parameters. 

The program should be able to apply to each element of the array the function passed as the second parameter and return a new array with this result. 

Case 1:
The first parameter should be an array

As a user, when I pass not an array as first parameter to the program, we see an error in the console that says 'first parameter is not an array'.

Case 2:
The second parameter should be a function

As a user, when I pass not a function as second parameter to the program, we see an error in the console that says 'second parameter is not a function'.

Case 3:
Sum by one

As a user, when I pass an array with numbers and call to the program, we get a new array with all numbers sumed by one.

Case 4:
Sum by two

As a user, when I pass an array with numbers and call to the program, we get a new array with all numbers sumed by two.


Case 5:
Sum by three

As a user, when I pass an array with numbers and call to the program, we get a new array with all numbers sumed by three.

Case 6:
Multiply by two

As a user, when I pass an array with numbers and call to the program, we get a new array with all numbers multiplied by two.

Case 7:
Rest by two

As a user, when I pass an array with numbers and call to the program, we get a new array with all numbers rested by two.

Case 8:
Divide by two

As a user, when I pass an array with numbers and call to the program, we get a new array with all numbers divided by two.

Case 9:
Convert to upper case

As a user, when I pass an array with strings in lower case and call to the program, we get a new array with all words to upper case.
